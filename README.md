# First Homework Assignment

Welcome to your first assignment! The goal is to help you become familiar with **VS Code**, **Python**, and **GitHub**. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our Python group.

## What You Need to Do

1. **Complete the `Exercise.py` file**:
   - Write code that returns `'I am ready to learn Python!'`.

2. **Use the `main.py` file**:
   - This file is for testing your code. You can run it as many times as needed to ensure your solution works correctly.

3. **Understand the `Test_Exercise.py` file**:
   - This file contains test cases for your code. You donâ€™t need to modify it, but it will be used to validate your solution.

## Additional Notes
- Files are separated to make the task easier to manage. If you have any confusion or need assistance, donâ€™t hesitate to ask.
- Focus on completing the `Exercise.py` file as the main task for today.

Good luck, and enjoy learning Python! ðŸš€
